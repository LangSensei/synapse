# Knowledge: Mandatory Neuron Confirmation for Spike Completion

## Metadata
- **Date:** 2026-02-07
- **Spike ID:** 20260207-4bc9
- **Tags:** manifesto, protocol, verification, neuron
- **Summary:** Updated the Synapse Manifesto to mandate a final confirmation checkpoint with the neuron before spike completion and strengthened "The Options Pattern" to eliminate open-ended questions across all agent interactions.

## Verified Patterns
- **Mandatory Confirmation Checkpoint**: Agents must explicitly solicit final approval from the neuron after technical verification is complete using the Options Pattern.
- **Strict Options Pattern**: Every interaction requiring user input must be structured as numbered options to ensure operational efficiency.

## System Constraints
- **Session Closure**: Direct completion without a checkpoint prevents the neuron from extending the spike with related objectives.

## Architectural Shifts
- **Explicit Handoff Protocol**: The transition from 'execution' to 'completion' now requires an explicit interactive confirmation step.
