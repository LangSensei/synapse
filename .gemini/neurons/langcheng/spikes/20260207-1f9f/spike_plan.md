# Spike Plan: Refine Adaptive Execution Loop

## Goal
Update `manifesto.md` to integrate **Plan** into an **Adaptive Execution Loop**, allowing for iterative planning and phase-by-phase execution with mandatory persistence checkpoints. Refactor for clarity and reduced duplication.

## Current Phase
Phase 7: Verification & Distillation

## Phases

### Phase 1: Discovery & Requirements
- [x] Analyze user request for iterative planning within the execution loop
- [x] Identify target text in `manifesto.md`
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 2: Planning & Structure
- [x] Draft the "Adaptive Execution Loop" structure
- [x] Document decisions in `findings.md`
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [x] Apply changes to `manifesto.md` (Initial adaptive loop)
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 4: Verification
- [x] Verify changes in `manifesto.md`
- [x] Update `knowledge.md`
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 5: Protocol Refactoring (Proposal)
- [x] Draft a consolidated version of the Execution Protocol to reduce duplication
- [x] Present proposal to neuron for confirmation
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 6: Final Implementation
- [x] Apply the confirmed refactored protocol
- [x] Final verification
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 7: Verification & Distillation
- [x] Run final `check-complete.ps1`
- [x] Seal `knowledge.md`
- **Status:** complete

## Key Questions
1. How to consolidate the persistence mandate and the execution loop without losing the specific "Phase Start/Completion" checkpoints?

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Rename to "Adaptive Execution Loop" | Reflects the iterative and evolving nature of the planning and execution process. |
| Nested "Plan" in loop | Ensures the roadmap is re-evaluated and updated as discovery progresses. |
| Consolidated Protocol | Reduces duplication while maintaining strict behavioral mandates. |

## Errors Encountered
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|

## Notes
- Planning is no longer a one-time setup but a living part of the loop.
- User requested consolidation of the protocol text.
