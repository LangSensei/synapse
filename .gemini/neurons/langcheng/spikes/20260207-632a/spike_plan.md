# Spike Plan: Update Knowledge Protocol

## Goal
Update the `manifesto.md` to require knowledge distillation upon completion of the "Verification" phase, rather than only at the very end of the spike.

## Current Phase
Phase 1

## Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery
- [x] Understand neuron intent (Shift `knowledge-with-files` timing)
- [x] Review `manifesto.md` content
- [x] Document findings in findings.md
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 2: Planning & Structure
- [x] Draft the new wording for Step 5
- [x] Ensure alignment with Step 4 (Verification)
- [x] Document decisions with rationale
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [x] Modify `manifesto.md`
- [x] Verify the change (Manual Read)
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 4: Delivery
- [x] Final distillation to knowledge.md
- [x] Sync Atlas
- **Status:** complete

## Key Questions
1. How to phrase the new mandate clearly? (Update Step 5 to trigger on Verification completion)

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Link to Verification | Ensures knowledge is distilled while context is fresh and before final sign-off. |


## Errors Encountered
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
|       | 1       |            |

## Notes
- Ensure the instruction mentions "Verification" explicitly as the trigger.
