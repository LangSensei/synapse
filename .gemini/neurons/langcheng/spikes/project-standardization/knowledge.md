# Knowledge: Project Initialization

## Metadata
- **Date:** 2026-02-06
- **Spike ID:** project-standardization
- **Tags:** initialization, synapse-protocol, project-structure
- **Summary:** Established the core Synapse System structure, including Cortex and Neuron layers.

## Verified Patterns
- **Synapse Structure**: The `.gemini` folder houses both `cortex` (global) and `neurons` (local/task-specific) layers.
- **Initialization Sequence**: Create directories -> Initialize Cortex -> Setup Task Neuron.

## System Constraints
- **Root Gateway**: `GEMINI.md` at root acts as the primary metadata provider for the agent but remains read-only after setup.

## Architectural Shifts
- **Protocol Establishment**: Defined the dual-layered cognitive architecture for AI-native engineering.
