# Spike Plan: Refactor Post-Completion Loop

## Goal
Update the `manifesto.md` to ensure that after a spike is completed, the agent shares a summary and returns to the "Context Discovery" phase to prepare for the next task.

## Current Phase
Phase 2

## Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery
- [x] Understand langcheng's intent for the post-completion loop.
- [x] Review current `manifesto.md` Completion Gate logic.
- [x] Document findings in findings.md.
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 2: Planning & Implementation
- [x] Draft the new post-completion sequence in `manifesto.md`.
- [x] Apply changes to `manifesto.md`.

- **Status:** complete

### Phase 3: Verification

- [x] Distill findings to `knowledge.md` (Active Status).
- [x] Request langcheng confirmation.
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 4: Finalization
- [x] Post-confirmation: Update `knowledge.md` (Completed Status).
- [x] Share final status and summary.

## Key Questions
1. Should the loop-back step be a sub-bullet of "Upon Confirmation" or a separate top-level step?

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
|          |           |

## Errors Encountered
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|

## Notes
