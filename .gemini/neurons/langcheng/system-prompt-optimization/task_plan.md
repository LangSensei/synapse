# Task Plan: System Prompt Optimization

## Goal
Optimize the Synapse System's core instructions, protocols, and templates (`.md` files) to enhance agent performance and ensure high-quality execution.

## Current Phase
Phase 1

## Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery
- [x] Configure project to publish Neurons to GitHub (for future optimization)
- [ ] Audit existing prompt files (`manifesto.md`, `planning-with-files/SKILL.md`, templates)
- [ ] Identify friction points in current agent-instruction alignment
- **Status:** in_progress

### Phase 2: Planning & Structure
- [ ] Design improved versions of core protocols
- [ ] Refine the 4-file pattern templates for better "working memory" utilization
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [x] Update `manifesto.md` with refined engineering standards (more direct instructions)
- [x] Optimize `planning-with-files` templates (reduced noise, more structure)
- [x] Enhance `planning-with-files/SKILL.md` to align with Neuron structure
- [x] Enhance `GEMINI.md` as a more effective gateway
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 4: Verification
- [x] Test the new prompts in a fresh task
- [x] Verify clarity and conciseness
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 5: Delivery
- [x] Distill optimization knowledge into `knowledge.md`
- [x] Commit and push all changes, including neuron history
- **Status:** complete

## Key Questions
1. How can the templates be structured to minimize context window bloat while maximizing relevant information?
2. Are the `manifesto.md` instructions clear enough for a new agent to pick up the protocol immediately?

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Publish Neurons | Provides a longitudinal dataset for prompt optimization and learning |

## Errors Encountered
